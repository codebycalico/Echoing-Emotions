This installation began as a way to help people who aren't around horses start to gain experience and understanding of the emotions that horses portray. 

More importantly, it emphasizes that horses are often a mirror of their environment and who is around them.
If there is fear in the air, from you, from other horses, or from other animals, they start to feel that fear, without understanding what they're fearful of.
If you're calm, that helps them to be calm.
They are highly sensitive prey creatures who, in the wild, survive off their instinctive empathy.
If we are confused or unaware of our own moods, they will reflect it to us regardless. Sometimes this can be quiet frustrating when we work with horses and they are annoyed, frustrating, or unwilling. It is in these moments that they are our greatest mirrors. If they're feeling something or behaving in a way that we don't understand, it's often a reflection of what we are expressing and the energy we are subconciously releasing to them.

When watching the corresponding clips, see if you can identify the changes in ear positioning and the muscles around the horses' eyes. As humans do, they express themselves through small nuances in their body language.
