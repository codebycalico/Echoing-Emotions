INSTRUCTIONS

1. To ask the program to start detecting your emotion, stand in front of the screen and give a thumbs up!
2. Exaggerate an emotional expression on your face. You can do HAPPY, SAD, or ANGRY.

A corresponding clip will play of a horse expressing that emotion. To do another emotion, repeat from step one!
