INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

Ask the program to start detecting an emotion by standing in front of the screen and giving a thumbs up!
The main video may pause for a moment to start the detection.

Showcase an emotion to be detected. You can do HAPPY, SAD, or ANGRY.

A corresponding clip will play of a horse expressing that emotion.

To have it detect another emotion, you will have to do another thumbs up!
